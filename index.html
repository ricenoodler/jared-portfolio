          <h2>üìú ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I‚Äôm Jared Del Mundo, a student pilot & computer science major passionate about aviation! I‚Äôm currently studying at University of Central Florida and Fly Umatilla LLC and love exploring aviation, web development, and IT.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how technology enhances complex systems, particularly in fields that demand precision and efficiency, like aviation. This curiosity led me to study computer science, where I developed skills in programming, data analysis, and system optimization. Over time, I‚Äôve worked on projects that bridge software and real-world applications, such as developing algorithms for optimizing logistics and real-time data processing. I‚Äôm particularly proud of leveraging technology to improve decision-making in high-stakes environments.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy volunteering for Rotary, composing and playing music as a musician, and walking in nature. I believe in giving back to the world as my thanks, and I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to grow personally and professionally. Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect or collaborate!
